# Reacting

## My journey of learning React

---

### Beginning

After I progressed considerably into JavaScript(hereafter called JS) and also implemented some of it in my [site](https://brokenbricks.netlify.app), I had a feeling there was more to make great sites, such as [this](https://www.seanv.dev). After trying to dig around a bit I learnt that it was made out of React(hereafter called R). After I digged further, I learned that React is a JS framework by Meta, the same company that runs Facebook. Say what you may about the platform or the company, the aesthetics and UI/UX are to die for. That is my goal here. What I also learned is that this framework is responsible to give the site an app-like feel, compared to the site-like feel of the past. So, I decided to learn React.

### First lessons

A google search and I found tons of resources. But 2 that stood out are:

- the official site of [ReactJS](https://www.reactjs.org)
- the book ['The Road to Learn React'](https://www.roadtoreact.com)

I generally prefer learning from a book over learning from videos, and the book was used as a reference in MIT. So I felt that it was genuinely good, so got the PDF. But before I started reading it, I also checked out the ReactJS official site. I learned there about some new things.

> - R works via **components**.
> - R components are JS functions that return markup code.
> - R components can be nested.
> - The markup returned by R is in JSX (something new to me for now), which is different from HTML.
> - R components are used as HTML-like tags with the difference being that R components names must start with Capital letters but HTML tags start with small letters
> - React doesn't explicitly tell how to implement CSS.

At this point I decided to stop and read the book and use the site only secondarily.

### The Inspiration

The book asked the readers to try teaching the material they learn as a learning exercise. It is a philosophy I believe in anyway so I decided to take the challenge up. The author said he will help promote such attempts, so perhaps this will become a blog that someone actually reads. I am unsure how to document the journey in text though. Typing out lectures will waste a lot of time. So the best idea I have now is to write my thoughts as a list of points.

### Introduction to React

- The app-like interface that I mentioned before in contrast to the old-school site-like interface is called [SPA](https://www.wikiperdia.com/single%20page%20%application.com) - Single Page Application.
- React is a view library, in something called the '[MVC]((https://www.wikiperdia.com/model%view%20%controller.com)) - Model View Controller' - which means it allows to render components as viewable elements.
